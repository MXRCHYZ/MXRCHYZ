Hey there! 
I'm @MXRCHYZ 👋🏻
And here's a bit of myself

I was born at 2006 as an Indonesian. 🇮🇩 (I'm a "he" btw)
I'm still dying at school at the moment. 😬
I think school is boring. At least for me.
I like reading books, programming, trading stocks, watch Korean dramas and listen to K-Pop.
Actually I'm currecntly learning programming and trading stocks by myself by reading books.
Obviously, I'm alone and I don't have any help.
So, if you are a kind person, I'd appriciate it if you help me through my struggles. (Especially programming)
I don't have a twitter account at the moment. But I have an Instagram account. It's @marchoginting. You can follow me.

Anyways, I think that's it about me.
Thank you for reading about me though. 😁
